<p>We would like to introduce the first “Collect to Earn” platform, which gamifies and socializes the collector’s experience.</p>
<p>Here would be a brief scope of the project’s features.</p>
<p>HERE WE GO!⛓</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>COLLECT</strong> — the versatile stock of game card collections. Currently, there are exhibited more than 75 collections of Dark Country, HodlGod, and Blockchain Heroes. But don’t count on permanence — partners will be changed occasionally.</li>
  <li>Complete the tasks, gain XP points, and Racoon Coins via Achievements — give your best shot!🧨</li>
  <li>Considering that <strong>COLLECT</strong> is a social platform, hence the user can add friends, collaborate, and share the deeds🎮</li>
  <li>Users can gain experience per collection and form leaderboards by rank in Collections, Achievements, and Assets.</li>
  <li>Not only the achievements but a Racoon Coins too💰</li>
</ol>
<p>1 Racoon Coin = 1 XP, which in the short run could be spent to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>buy NFTs,</li>
  <li>participate in private sales,</li>
  <li>take part in VIP program.</li>
</ul>
