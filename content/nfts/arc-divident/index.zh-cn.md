<p>Token - ARC</p>
<p>Arch is a token that brings profit in the form of dividends to all its holders.</p>
<p>For example, if you have 10,000 Arc tokens on your wallet balance, then you will automatically be included in the list of those who will receive weekly dividend payments.</p>
<p>Example with a balance of 10,000 ARC tokens, holding tokens on a balance of 10,000 thousand, you will receive +630 ARC tokens on the day of payment. If the balance is 20,000, then you get twice as much, respectively.</p>
